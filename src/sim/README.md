# Bike Simulation

## Running the Sim

Start containers and run the sim:

1. `docker compose up`
2. `docker exec -it --user root autobike_dev bash`
3. `build`
4. `ros2 launch sim robot_launch.py`

Open the GUI

5. `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`
6. Give [Webot](https://cyberbotics.com/) a minute

Send commands to the driver

1. `docker exec -it --user root autobike_dev bash` for another terminal
v TODO: update robot driver to listen to output of pure pursuit container :D
1. `ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  "linear: { x: 0.1 }"`

## Tips

Enable "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon" in "Settings > Features in Development", otherwise it is horribly slow (still is extremely slow, since we are emulating a different architecture and also containerized--I anticipate the biggest hit is the emulation, and plan on running on the Jetson to see how much faster it is on native hardware)
